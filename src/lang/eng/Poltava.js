        title: 'Poltava',
        article: 'Poltava is one of the best-known Ukrainian cities. It was made famous by its uncommon fate, plethora of historic monuments and important architectural achievements, as well as its amazing natural recourses, and the inexhaustible cordiality of its denizens. Today, this charming city is an important cultural center with an unmatched spiritual heritage, attracting a multitude of travelers from all over the world. The history of Poltava spans more than eleven centuries. It was named after "Ltava,” the source of the Vorskla River, on whose picturesque bank the city stands. Until the 16th century, Poltava was a part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, later becoming a part of Poland, and from the 17th century, Russia. The city has had a complicated fate: for centuries, it was pushed into military conflicts. The key event that radically changed Poltava’s (and Europe’s) destiny was the famous Poltava Battle, which took place here in 1709. It settled the outcome of Northern War that had lasted for over 20 years between Sweden and Russia. During the fight, the Russian army (headed by Peter the Great) crushed the troops of Carl XII. The battlefield where the bloody clash took place is now a national reserve. It is the only historical-cultural conservation area in the country that is a part of UNESCO’s International Association of Museums of Arms and Military History. On its territory stands the Museum of the Poltava Battle’s History, whose collection numbers over 8,000 unique exhibits.',
